This is a whole repository dedicated to Stutern Software Engineering Training :woman_technologist: :woman_technologist:
I am going to be constantly updating files containing story highlights about my learning journey :sweat_smile:

#more commits when I finally get a full hang of this coding stuff :rofl:

p.s: So far, the learning journey has been adventurous, we never back down from doing hard things :v: :grin: :muscle: :woman_technologist:
